You are a senior Python developer specializing in Generative AI. Your task is to write a Python script that defines a single function, **`generate_summary(x12_file: str)`**, within an existing Flask or FastAPI API project. This function will take a raw X12 healthcare EDI file string as input and generate a concise, human-readable summary.

The function's implementation should follow these mandatory requirements:

- **LangChain** for orchestration.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture.
- **PDO Prompt Engineering** practices.
- **LangSmith** for observability and tracing.

The function should be completely self-contained and ready to be integrated into an existing API endpoint.

***

### 1. Module Dependencies & Setup

Inside the `generate_summary` function, or within the module scope, include all necessary imports from libraries like `langchain`, `langchain_community`, `faiss-cpu`, and `python-dotenv`. Use comments to explain the purpose of each import. 

Add a comment explaining that the dependencies must be installed beforehand with commands such as: `pip install langchain langchain_community faiss-cpu python-dotenv`

Add the LangSmith environment variable setup directly inside the function or in a module-level setup block. Use placeholders for `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` and `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, and include a comment instructing the user to replace these with their actual keys.

### 2. Data and Knowledge Base

Create a simplified, in-memory knowledge base of X12 segment definitions. This data should be defined as a Python dictionary or list of tuples and should be accessible by the `generate_summary` function.

- **Mock Data**: Include mock data for common X12 segments (e.g., `ST*837`, `NM1*IL`, `CLM*01`) and their plain-English descriptions.
- **Denial Codes**: Add mock data for common denial or rejection codes (e.g., "CO-45: Charges exceed maximum allowable amount").

---

### 3. RAG Implementation with LangChain

Implement the RAG architecture using LangChain components.

- **Vector Store**: Use `FAISS` to create an in-memory vector index from the mock knowledge base data. This should be a one-time setup within the function or module scope.
- **Retriever**: Create a retriever object from the vector store.
- **Mock X12 Parser**: Create a helper function, `x12_parser(file_content: str)`, that takes a mock X12 file string and returns a dictionary of parsed segments. The mock file should be a simple multi-line string.

---

### 4. LangChain Agent Orchestration

Design a `conversational_retrieval_agent` or similar to handle the summarization task.

- **Tools**: The agent should be given two tools: the `x12_parser` function and the vector store retriever.
- **Logic**: The agent's logic, invoked by the `generate_summary` function, should:
    - Receive the X12 file string as input.
    - Use the parser tool to get the raw segments.
    - Use the retriever tool to look up segment definitions and denial code explanations from the vector store.
    - **Crucially, assemble all this information into a single, cohesive prompt.**

### 5. PDO Prompt Engineering

Within the agent's orchestration logic, construct the final prompt to the LLM using the PDO (Problem, Details, Objective) format.

- **Problem**: State the task: "Generate a detailed, human-readable summary of the provided X12 healthcare claim file."
- **Details**: Provide the raw parsed segments and the definitions retrieved from the vector store. Instruct the LLM to identify and explain any denial codes.
- **Objective**: Instruct the LLM on the desired output format: "Output a clear summary of the claim, including patient info, provider, services, charges, payments, and a list of any detected errors or rejections, using plain English and avoiding technical jargon."

---

### 6. Function Structure & Execution

Organize the code into a single, well-structured function named `generate_summary`.

- **Function Signature**: `def generate_summary(x12_file: str):`
- **LLM Setup**: Define the LLM inside the function (use a placeholder like `ChatOpenAI` and a comment explaining the API key requirements).
- **Return Value**: The function should return the final, human-readable summary string generated by the LangChain agent.
- **Example Usage**: Outside the function definition, provide a sample `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that demonstrates how to call the function with a mock X12 file string and print the result to the console.
